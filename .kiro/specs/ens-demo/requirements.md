# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) demo project. The purpose of this project is to create a learning environment where users can interact with ENS functionality through both smart contracts and a web interface. The demo will showcase core ENS features including name registration, subdomain management, forward lookups, and reverse lookups. The project will be structured as a monorepo containing both the smart contracts (built with Foundry) and a React-based frontend, with Docker Compose configuration for easy deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Smart Contract Implementation

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want to implement ENS-like smart contracts, so that I can understand how ENS works at the contract level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the smart contracts THEN the system SHALL initialize a root ENS registry.
2. WHEN a user calls the registration function with a valid name and payment THEN the system SHALL register the name to the user's address.
3. WHEN a name owner calls the subdomain creation function THEN the system SHALL create a subdomain under the parent domain.
4. WHEN a user queries a registered name THEN the system SHALL return the associated address.
5. WHEN a user queries an address THEN the system SHALL return any associated name that has been set for reverse lookup.
6. WHEN a name owner calls the update function THEN the system SHALL update the name's resolver data.
7. WHEN a name registration expires THEN the system SHALL make the name available for registration again.
8. WHEN deploying in a test environment THEN the system SHALL pre-register some example domains for demonstration purposes.

### Requirement 2: React Frontend Implementation

**User Story:** As an end user, I want a user-friendly web interface to interact with the ENS contracts, so that I can use ENS features without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the frontend THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard showing connected wallet information and owned names.
2. WHEN a user submits the registration form with a valid name and payment THEN the system SHALL register the name and update the UI accordingly.
3. WHEN a user selects one of their domains THEN the system SHALL display management options including subdomain creation.
4. WHEN a user enters a name in the lookup form THEN the system SHALL display the associated address if it exists.
5. WHEN a user enters an address in the reverse lookup form THEN the system SHALL display any associated name.
6. WHEN a user is not connected to a wallet THEN the system SHALL prompt them to connect.
7. WHEN a transaction is pending THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators.
8. WHEN a transaction succeeds or fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate success or error messages.
9. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL automatically connect to the local blockchain specified in the Docker setup.

### Requirement 3: Monorepo Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized monorepo structure, so that I can easily navigate and maintain both the contract and frontend code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cloning the repository THEN the system SHALL have separate directories for contracts and frontend.
2. WHEN in the contracts directory THEN the system SHALL follow Foundry project structure conventions.
3. WHEN in the frontend directory THEN the system SHALL follow React project structure conventions.
4. WHEN running setup commands THEN the system SHALL install all dependencies for both contracts and frontend.
5. WHEN making changes to contracts THEN the system SHALL have a mechanism to update contract ABIs in the frontend.
6. WHEN running test commands THEN the system SHALL execute tests for both contracts and frontend components.

### Requirement 4: Docker Compose Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Docker Compose configuration, so that I can easily start the entire application stack with a single command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `docker-compose up` THEN the system SHALL start a local Ethereum node with the deployed contracts.
2. WHEN running `docker-compose up` THEN the system SHALL start the frontend development server.
3. WHEN the containers are running THEN the system SHALL expose the frontend on a configurable port.
4. WHEN the containers are running THEN the system SHALL expose the blockchain RPC on a configurable port.
5. WHEN stopping the containers THEN the system SHALL preserve blockchain state for the next startup.
6. WHEN restarting the containers THEN the system SHALL reconnect all components automatically.
7. WHEN running in Docker THEN the system SHALL have appropriate environment variables for configuration.

### Requirement 5: Development Experience

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want comprehensive documentation and development tools, so that I can understand and extend the project easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the README THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup and usage instructions.
2. WHEN running the project THEN the system SHALL include helpful logging for debugging.
3. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading for frontend changes.
4. WHEN testing contracts THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive test coverage.
5. WHEN deploying contracts THEN the system SHALL use scripts that are easy to understand and modify.
6. WHEN using the frontend THEN the system SHALL have a responsive design that works on different screen sizes.
7. WHEN contributing to the project THEN the system SHALL have clear coding standards and contribution guidelines.
